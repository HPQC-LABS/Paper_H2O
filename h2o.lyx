\begin_layout Abstract
The total electronic energy for the ground electronic state of a water molecule,
 using the standard molecular Hamiltonian and a Dunning basis set with 957
 spatial orbitals (1914 spin orbitals), is calculated with the two deepest
 core electrons frozen and the 8 remaining electrons fully correlated.
 The 8-electron energy is estimated to be accurate to within 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm$
\end_inset

2 micro-hartree of the true energy for this Hamiltonian and basis set.
 The calculations were done using a fully deterministic, composite coupled
 cluster approach.

 If total energies can be calculated with a precision of

 Therefore calculating total electronic energies of the water molecule to
 a precision of around 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm3$
\end_inset


\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset Formula $\mu E_{h}$

 or better can be seen as a first step towards determining electronic properties
 (ionization energies, electron affinities, Born-Oppenheimer potential energy
 surfaces, and even atomization energies and anything else in which the
 only significant energy change is electronic) of the water molecule with
 unprecedented precision.
 The total electronic energy of a molecule can have many calculations contributi
ng to it, and none of them can be calculated with a precision worse than
 about

Hardware
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite the largest calculations in this work being state-of-the-art by
 a large margin, they were actually done on relatively old hardware (all
 calculations were done in 2019 on hardware from

\end_inset

2014).
 While this would have made the calculations significantly slower than they
 could have been (in terms of wall clock time), it meant that access to
 the hardware was more readily available than if using any of the newer
 (and more in-demand by other scientists) resources available to the author.
 This was especially important, since there was a lot of de-bugging involved,
 as the 1- and 2-electron integrals, SCF (self-consistent field) calculations,
 and AO to MO transformation were done with a new code, which had not been
 tested on such basis sets before.
 Furthermore, the particular nodes on which the calculations were done,
 happened to have 55T of node local storage, which was in fact necessary
 for the calculations using the biggest basis sets, and is not available
 on any of the other resources available to the author.

[Check if I used 768G at any point..
 I did for xvcc part of 9z CCSD(T) and same for ncc 9z for CCSDT, the 9z
 MRCC CCSD(T) was done with 512G on wob149, 8Z cc files need to be found,
 everything else either requested for only 511G, or only required at most
 511G, but best way to double-check would be to look at the jobID's (though
 not necessary if it's too much truoble, since I just checked everything
 (except 8z still to do) and am certain enough that 9z was the only place
 where > 512G was needed ...
 but wait ..
 some calcs did use 32G, so specific nodes may need to be checked].

The standard non-relativistic molecular electronic Hamiltonian with the
 clamped nucleus (Born-Oppenheimer) approximation and the point-sized nucleus
 approximation, was used.
 This Hamiltonian has been called NR-CPN (non-relativistic, with clamped
 and point-sized nucleus) in the past

Additionally, no fine or hyperfine terms are included, such as eQq, and
 the two deepest core electrons are not correlated (only the other 8 electrons
 are correlated with each other)

Basis sets

\begin_layout Standard
The electronic wavefunction was modeled using a linear combination of atomic
 orbitals (LCAO) in which Gaussian-type basis sets were used for the atomic
 orbitals.
 A series of these basis sets was used, from the

1- and 2-electron integral calculations

\begin_layout Standard
The transformed integrals were calculated with the 
\begin_inset Formula ${\tt CFOUR}$
\end_inset

 keyword 
\begin_inset Formula ${\tt XFORM\_TOL}$
\end_inset

 set to 18 as opposed to the default value of 11, meaning that only integrals
 with values smaller than 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-18}$
\end_inset

 would be neglected as opposed to the default tolerance threshold of 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-11}$

Hartree-Fock calculations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
RHF (restricted Hartree-Fock) calculations were done with the spin multiplicity
 set to 1 (to obtain a singlet state).
 A core Hamiltonian initial guess was used, with no restriction on the occupatio
n numbers in terms of spatial symmetry within the 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{2v}$

 point group which was used, but at convergence the final occupation numbers
 were always 6 for the

uncertainty of 200 comes from the fact that CCSDTQP(H)-CCSDTQP got smaller
 by 0.000001514664987 in 3z-2z, so could potentially get bigger by 2 uH from
 3z to 4z.
 20 comes from same argument but now it's 0.000000169944002 which is one
 order of magnitude smaller.
 Everything else is just simply adding uncertainties from previous column.
 Really should probably be sqrt(a^2 + b^2) but instead I did a+b for now.

Bottlenecks: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
- speed of CCSDTQ for 7Z (cfour will take 150 days? with 768G or would require
 1.5T which doesn't allow more than 30 days, and NCC doesn't allow restarts
 ...
 not sure about MRCC...
 Hanrath program unavailable.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
- speed of CCSDTQP for 5Z (lack of hand-coded CCSDTQP, lack of parallel
 I/O in MRCC, lack of Hanrath code, speed of CC-QMC to get error down).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
- ability to do CCSDTQ(P) for 5Z/6Z, or CCSDT(Q) for 7Z, 8Z, 9Z (MRCC can't
 restart perturbative calculations).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
- getting higher than CCSDTQP is not necessary for any basis sets that it's
 not already possible for, and getting higher than CCSDTQ does not seem
 necessary for anything beyond 7Z?
